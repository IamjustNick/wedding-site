        <h1>Wedding Details</h1>

<h2>📍 When &amp; Where?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ceremony:</strong> <strong>Saturday, July 5th, at 15:00</strong> at <strong>Holy Trinity Church, Supraśl</strong><br />
<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/awo4oxo399xgwkPA8">📍 Google Maps</a></li>
<li><strong>Reception:</strong> <strong>Maciejówka Borki</strong>, a village <strong>30 km from the church</strong><br />
<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZtGkxrp5NXeq9ZGX7">📍 Google Maps</a></li>
</ul>

<p>🚗 <strong>Getting there:</strong><br />
You can drive directly to the church, but we <strong>highly recommend arriving in Maciejówka Borki on July 4th</strong>. A <strong>bus will take guests from Maciejówka to the church at 14:00</strong> (exact time TBC). After the ceremony the same bus will take us back to the party.</p>

<p>🛏️ <strong>Accommodation:</strong><br />
We’ve reserved rooms for guests traveling from abroad. The <strong>Saturday-Sunday night stay is free</strong>. If you’d like to arrive a day earlier, let us know—we can book your room for about <strong>€24 per person</strong>.</p>

<h2><strong>🌿 Wedding Style</strong></h2>

<p>Maciejówka is a <strong>rural retreat</strong> surrounded by forest, offering a cozy and relaxed atmosphere rather than a luxury hotel experience. Expect a <strong>charming, rustic setting</strong> with wooden cabins, open spaces, and plenty of nature.</p>

<h1>✈️ How to Get There</h1>

<h2><strong>Option 1: Via Warsaw (Recommended)</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Step 1: Fly into Warsaw</strong></h3>

<p>The nearest airports:<br />
- <strong>Warsaw Chopin Airport (WAW)</strong> (best option, close to the city center: Wizzair, Iberia, LOT)<br />
- <strong>Warsaw Modlin Airport (WMI)</strong> (50 km from Warsaw, Ryanair only)</p>

<h3><strong>Step 2: Train from Warsaw to Białystok</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>Depart from <strong>Warszawa Centralna</strong> (Warsaw Central Station), reachable from Chopin Airport by taxi, bus, or train.</li>
<li>Take an <strong>Intercity (IC) or Express InterCity (EIC) train</strong> to <strong>Białystok</strong> (~2–2.5 hours).  From here the simplest option is to book a taxi, uber (or bolt) or rent a car for the area and get directly to Maceijowka.</li>
</ul>

<p>🎟️ <strong>Booking tickets:</strong><br />
Visit <a href="https://ebilet.intercity.pl/">PKP Intercity</a> and select <strong>Warszawa Centralna → Białystok</strong>.<br />
Tickets cost <strong>€5–15</strong>, depending on demand. Groups may get discounts.</p>

<h2><strong>Alternative Routes</strong></h2>

<p>If you're planning to explore more of Poland, you might find flights to <strong>Kraków, Gdańsk, or Katowice</strong>. We <strong>only recommend this option</strong> if you find a <strong>very cheap flight</strong> and have a few extra days to travel.</p>

<p>Kraków, a popular tourist destination, is the farthest city from Supraśl, so getting to the wedding from there requires extra travel time.</p>

<p>To reach <strong>Białystok from Kraków</strong>, you can book a train ticket via <a href="https://ebilet.intercity.pl/">PKP Intercity</a>. The journey takes around <strong>5 hours</strong> and typically requires a <strong>train transfer</strong> in <strong>Warsaw</strong>.</p>

<h1>🎉 Useful Information About Wedding Etiquette in Poland  </h1>

<ul>
<li>💌 <strong>Gifts:</strong> In Poland, wedding gifts are typically given in the form of <strong>cash</strong> rather than physical presents.</li>
<li>👗 <strong>Dress Code:</strong> <strong>Formal summer attire</strong> is expected—<strong>no T-shirts, jeans, or tracksuits</strong>, but there’s no need for <strong>tuxedos</strong> either.</li>
<li>🌿 <strong>Venue &amp; Footwear:</strong> The wedding will take place in a <strong>rural setting</strong> surrounded by <strong>grass, trees, and a touch of hippie nonsense</strong>. If you plan on wearing high heels, we strongly recommend bringing a pair of comfortable shoes for later in the night.</li>
<li>🍽️ <strong>Food &amp; Timing:</strong> Since the celebration doesn’t start until early evening, we recommend <strong>having a hearty breakfast or a light lunch before the ceremony</strong> to keep you going.</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>International Relations:</strong> Guests are kindly asked <strong>not to defect to Belarus</strong> during the wedding. We would find that extremely rude.</li>
<li>🍾 <strong>Polish weddings are a feast, not just a dinner!</strong> Instead of a single meal, food is served in <strong>multiple rounds throughout the night</strong>, with dancing in between. After midnight, it’s tradition to serve a <strong>hearty soup</strong> to keep the energy up!</li>
<li>🎶 <strong>The official party lasts until 4 AM, but the night doesn’t have to end there!</strong> Since most of us are staying at the venue—<strong>in the middle of nowhere with nothing around</strong>—even after the DJ wraps up, we can keep the celebration going with late-night conversations and drinks.</li>
<li><p>On <strong>Sunday</strong>  after 11:00 am we will have a post wedding celebration that will probably include some kind of barbecue type of food (details to be confirmed)<br />

<h1>🇵🇱 Useful Tourist Information About Poland</h1></li>
<li><p>💳 <strong>Cash or Card?</strong> Almost everywhere in Poland accepts <strong>card payments</strong>, regardless of the amount—so you won’t need much cash.</p></li>
<li>💰 <strong>Currency:</strong> The local currency is the <strong>Polish złoty (PLN)</strong>. The exchange rate is roughly <strong>4 PLN = 1 EUR</strong>, but it’s always good to check current rates.</li>
<li>☀️ <strong>Weather in Summer:</strong> Expect <strong>warm days and cooler nights</strong>, so bring a light jacket for the evenings. If you're familiar with <strong>Galicia in the summer</strong>, the climate is quite similar!</li>
