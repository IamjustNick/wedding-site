  [📍 Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZtGkxrp5NXeq9ZGX7)

🚗 **Getting there:**
You can drive directly to the church, but we **highly recommend arriving in Maciejówka Borki on July 4th**. A **bus will take guests from Maciejówka to the church at 14:00** (exact time TBC). After the ceremony the same bus will take us back to the party.

🛏️ **Accommodation:**
We’ve reserved rooms for guests traveling from abroad. The **Saturday-Sunday night stay is free**. If you’d like to arrive a day earlier, let us know—we can book your room for about **€24 per person**.

## **🌿 Wedding Style**

  Maciejówka is a **rural retreat** surrounded by forest, offering a cozy and relaxed atmosphere rather than a luxury hotel experience. Expect a **charming, rustic setting** with wooden cabins, open spaces, and plenty of nature.

# ✈️ How to Get There

## **Option 1: Via Warsaw (Recommended)**
### **Step 1: Fly into Warsaw**
The nearest airports:
- **Warsaw Chopin Airport (WAW)** (best option, close to the city center: Wizzair, Iberia, LOT)
- **Warsaw Modlin Airport (WMI)** (50 km from Warsaw, Ryanair only)

### **Step 2: Train from Warsaw to Białystok**
- Depart from **Warszawa Centralna** (Warsaw Central Station), reachable from Chopin Airport by taxi, bus, or train.
- Take an **Intercity (IC) or Express InterCity (EIC) train** to **Białystok** (~2–2.5 hours).  From here the simplest option is to book a taxi, uber (or bolt) or rent a car for the area and get directly to Maceijowka.

🎟️ **Booking tickets:**
Visit [PKP Intercity](https://ebilet.intercity.pl/) and select **Warszawa Centralna → Białystok**.
Tickets cost **€5–15**, depending on demand. Groups may get discounts.
## **Alternative Routes**
If you're planning to explore more of Poland, you might find flights to **Kraków, Gdańsk, or Katowice**. We **only recommend this option** if you find a **very cheap flight** and have a few extra days to travel.

Kraków, a popular tourist destination, is the farthest city from Supraśl, so getting to the wedding from there requires extra travel time.

To reach **Białystok from Kraków**, you can book a train ticket via [PKP Intercity](https://ebilet.intercity.pl/). The journey takes around **5 hours** and typically requires a **train transfer** in **Warsaw**.

# 🎉 Useful Information About Wedding Etiquette in Poland  

- 💌 **Gifts:** In Poland, wedding gifts are typically given in the form of **cash** rather than physical presents.
- 👗 **Dress Code:** **Formal summer attire** is expected—**no T-shirts, jeans, or tracksuits**, but there’s no need for **tuxedos** either.
- 🌿 **Venue & Footwear:** The wedding will take place in a **rural setting** surrounded by **grass, trees, and a touch of hippie nonsense**. If you plan on wearing high heels, we strongly recommend bringing a pair of comfortable shoes for later in the night.
- 🍽️ **Food & Timing:** Since the celebration doesn’t start until early evening, we recommend **having a hearty breakfast or a light lunch before the ceremony** to keep you going.
- 🚫 **International Relations:** Guests are kindly asked **not to defect to Belarus** during the wedding. We would find that extremely rude.
- 🍾 **Polish weddings are a feast, not just a dinner!** Instead of a single meal, food is served in **multiple rounds throughout the night**, with dancing in between. After midnight, it’s tradition to serve a **hearty soup** to keep the energy up!
-  🎶 **The official party lasts until 4 AM, but the night doesn’t have to end there!** Since most of us are staying at the venue—**in the middle of nowhere with nothing around**—even after the DJ wraps up, we can keep the celebration going with late-night conversations and drinks.
- On **Sunday**  after 11:00 am we will have a post wedding celebration that will probably include some kind of barbecue type of food (details to be confirmed)
